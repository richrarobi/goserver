# goserver
simple golang server for distributed local linux systems including Raspberry Pi
From an original post by eliben, I am extending the server to allow a form af RPC (but NOT using RPC as such).

I am planning to grow the whole environment so any go or python3 client can access specific functions on other systems.
This will facilitate any Raspberry pi or other (Unix/Linux preferred) systems to use e.g maths functions on faster pc's,
or to do things like set led's remotely on one or more Raspi systems.

Next is to incorporate Blinkt functionality, and then look at maybe prime numbers, etc.
